# Module 01: Getting Started With Images

## Image Basics

### Geometry of Image Formation 

Understanding the theory of how an image is formed and camera intrisnics

In this simplified camera model, the pinhole size and focal length can be used to determine the expected size of an object, and its relationship to distance from the camera

In order to keep an object in focus across a lense, the object must be projected within an intersection plane between a ray across the center of the lense and a ray normal to the lense
