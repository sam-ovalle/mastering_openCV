## Module 1: Getting Started with Images

Learning how to read in, modify, annotate, save, and display images

The image New_Zealand_Boat.jpg is read into openCV, cropped, resized to double the size, and flipped

![Alt text](module01-getting-started-with-images/readme/01_03_exercise.png "Image of New Zealand boat used in exercise")

The image Apollo-11-launch.jpgis read into openCV, text is added, and a rectangle is placed on the shuttle rocket

## Module 2: Arithmetic Logic and Thresholding

Learning how to change brightness, contrast, create binary masks, combine images, and remove backgrounds using alpha channels

The contrast is modified using matrix multiplication

Thresholding is used to create binary masks where musical notes exist

![Alt text](module02-arithmetic-logical-thresholding/readme/02_02_exercise.png "Image of Music Sheet and output binary image")

The background of this sign JPEG image was removed, using binary masks to isolate the non-background component of the image, and merging this mask as the alpha channel to form a PNG

An openCV logo watermark was placed on this image using masks and cv2.addWeighted()

![Alt text](module02-arithmetic-logical-thresholding/readme/02_05_exercise8.png "Images for exercise M02.05")

An e-signature transparent png was created from a handrawn signature imported as JPEG

## Module 3: Histograms and Color Segmentation

Learning how to analyze the distribution of values aross channels of an image, and techniques to improve image quality or segment images from this

The histograms of multiple channels of an image, or even the mask of an object in an image, can be plotted

![Alt text](module03-histograms-and-color-segmentation/readme/03_01_exercise3.png "Image of improved color contrast due to equalizing HSV channel histograms instead")
![Alt text](module03-histograms-and-color-segmentation/readme/03_01_exercise4.png "Image of improved color contrast due to equalizing HSV channel histograms instead")

Histogram equalization can be used across multiple channels to improve contrast of an image. HSV equalization is best for color images

![Alt text](module03-histograms-and-color-segmentation/readme/03_01_exercise8.png "Image of improved color contrast due to equalizing HSV channel histograms instead")

Color Segmentation across HSV values using cv2.inRange() can be used to isolate an object in an image into a mask, such as this New Zealand lake

![Alt text](module03-histograms-and-color-segmentation/readme/03_02_exercise3.png "Image of color segmentation of New Zealand Lake into mask")

An application of color space segmentation to analyze deforestation over the years is explored

GeoTIFF LandSAT 7 channel images are used to accurately determine the loss of vegetation over time, as the near infrared channel enables segmentation using NDVI method to determine the color space of vegetation

![Alt text](module03-histograms-and-color-segmentation/readme/03_04_exercise2.png "Image of NDVI method formula from near infrared and red channels")
![Alt text](module03-histograms-and-color-segmentation/readme/03_04_exercise3.png "Image of NDVI images and binary masks across the year, more accurately representing loss of vegetation in the area")

## Module 4: Video Processing and Analysis

Learning how to read video files, edit frames, and write video files using openCV

An application of video processing (motion detection through using binary masks generated by subtracting prior frames from current frames and eroding away noise) is explored

Binary masks such as these could be thresholded to determine if motion is detected (if enough pixels are not zero, notable motion has occured -> trigger event)
